    "\n",
    "Ans- Data encoding involves converting a sequence of text characters into binary code so computers, which operate using binary numbers, can process, store, or transmit that textual information. Decoding occurs when the information is then translated from binary form into a readable version."

    "Ans- When we have a feature where variables are just names and there is no order or rank to this variable's feature. For example: City of person lives in, Gender of person, Marital Status, etcâ€¦ In the above example, We do not have any order or rank, or sequence."
